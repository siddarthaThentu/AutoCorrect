# AutoCorrect
AutoCorrect program implemented in python.

The program prefers one edit suggestion upto two edit suggestions and returns the same.

The corpus used is in a file called "shakespeare.txt". Since this is shakespeare text, the vocabulary is small and limited. This program scales with bigger data. Better the corpus, better the results.

How to run:

Download both files and run "main.py"
